        The Witcher is a series of six fantasy novels and 15 short stories written by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski.
        The series revolves around the eponymous "witcher," Geralt of Rivia.
        In Sapkowski's works, "witchers" are beast hunters who develop supernatural abilities at a young age to battle wild beasts and monsters.
        <br />
        Andrezj Sapkowski’s approach to epic fantasy isn’t what you might expect from a swords-and-sorcery tale of monsters, monarchs, and war.
        While The Witcher universe can at times rival Game of Thrones for bleakness and violence, the overall tone of the story is surprisingly lighthearted.
        <br />
        Take Geralt of Rivia. Our romantic hero may be a super-badass, but he’s also hilariously socially awkward.
        The quirks of his profession allow him to brood on the monstrousness of humanity, as you might expect — but also to find unexpected and delightful connections with some of those very same monsters.
